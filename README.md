# Cursor Clone (The Poor Man's Cursor) 🐢💻

### Live Demo
👉 https://cursor-uri3.vercel.app/

### Current Status
- Works (mostly)  
- Looks... okay-ish?  
- First time writing this many lines of code in one project  
- Alignment? What alignment?  
- Colors? I picked them with my heart (and zero design sense)
### Known Issues
- Things might be misaligned (welcome to my aesthetic)  
- Colors may cause eye bleeding  
- Mobile? What's that?  
- If you zoom in/out the whole thing might cry  

### Special Thanks
- Chaiaurcode team for 1st time introducing me to this.
- To my past self who wrote 10-line scripts and thought that was "a lot"
